# Java-project
Design and implement a console-based Java application called Campus Course &amp; Records Manager (CCRM) that lets an institute manage:
● Students (create/update, enroll/unenroll in courses)
● Courses (create/update, list, search, assign instructors)
● Grades & Transcripts (record marks, compute GPA, print transcripts)
● File Utilities (import/export CSV/JSON-like plain files, archive/backup course data)

This is a Java SE project built and run locally. It must be structured with clear packages,
demonstrate OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism), robust exception
handling, modern I/O with NIO.2, Streams, Date/Time API, and include interfaces, abstract
classes, nested classes, enums, lambdas, recursion, and design patterns (Singleton &
Builder).
